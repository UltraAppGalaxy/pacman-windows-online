            <span class="role">Idea For The Making :</span> I got the Idea to make this Game after remembering way back to 1985, My Parents Bought me an Atari 5500 And It came with the game " Pacman! " I loved that game. In 2025 I thought how cool it would be to Create My Own Pacman Game only Implementing Features the original game Doesn't Have, like the All new 2025 Game Cookie Man...

            <span class="role"> Development Tools Used :</span> I Created  The Pacman Game Using  The Web Master App. I then Used an Online Web To App Generator to Compile  It Into an APK App. After I Compiled and Built the App I then Used APK Editor Pro On Android as well as MT Manager Pro for Android To Tweak The App and To Make  Some Minor Changes. The Graphics Contained Within The App I Used PicsArt Pro and PhotoRoom Pro Two Graphic App's On Android... For the Launcher Icons I used an Online Android Launcher Icon Generator... I may release the Complete Source Code to My Pacman Game For Free Eventually But For Now You Must Purchase It For A Fee Of $500.00 You can buy it from the Official Web Page!
